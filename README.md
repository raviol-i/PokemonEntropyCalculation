# Pokemon Entropy Calculation

This is a personal project I created so I can get a better understanding of the Go language.

This project is based off of the Pokemon themed wordle clone, [Squirdle](https://squirdle.fireblend.com/).  
Inspiration for the project was taken from the following [3blue1brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA).

The main entropy calculation will tell the user how many pokemon (on average) will be left over after a given guess.  
The number of guesses made can be adjusted to be one or two deep.  
Calculation run times decreased from 45 seconds in Python to 3 seconds in Go ðŸ”¥

The results are stored in the results.csv file. Take a look and have fun!
